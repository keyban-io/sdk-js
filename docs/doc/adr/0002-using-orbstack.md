# 2. Using orbstack

Date: 2024-04-30

## Status

Accepted

## Context

docker desktop or orbstack

We are starting to use mac for everything now.

Kei says a lot of good things about orbstack and a lot of bad things about
docker desktop (on mac).

## Decision

Let's try orbstack. We can fallback on using docker desktop in the future if
need be.

## Consequences

We will need to make sure the dev stack (clk k8s etc.) will work with that.
