# Keyban Scaffolding App

This scaffold allows you to quickly set up a Keyban-based React wallet application.

## Quick Start

To create and run the app, follow these steps:

```bash
cd $(mktemp -d)
npm init @keyban/keyban-app
```

The app will automatically launch, and you can access it by opening your browser at the URL shown in the terminal (usually `http://localhost:5173/`).

### Steps in the browser:

1. **Click "Login"**.
2. **Login** using the default pre-configured account.
3. You will then see the basic information about your wallet, including your public key and balance on the Ethereum Sepolia testnet.

> **Note:** For this demo, no additional configuration or Auth0 account is needed as the app uses default credentials.
